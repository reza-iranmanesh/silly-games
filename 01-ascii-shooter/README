Objective:
ASCII Character on the left shoots the ASCII character on the right

How to play:
'i' to move up
'k' to move down
space to shoot

Notes:
Works on Mac; should be fine on Linux too (or bash on windows)
~100 lines of code, trying to stick to the primitives and not use ANY high level library to demostrate the use of thread
